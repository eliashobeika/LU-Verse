This is the first website I have ever created. It taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The site is frontend-only, as that was the scope of the related university course.

The most valuable lesson I learned—something I wish I had known earlier—was how useful Flexbox is for layout!
I still have a lot to learn, especially in design. For example, I regret not taking better advantage of the desktop screen width, but this project is my starting point.

Note: The PDF links on the I2202 pages are broken because I don’t have permission to share my teacher’s course materials.
Also, we only made an I2202 page, as replicating that for other courses was unnecessary.

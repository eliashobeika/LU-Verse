# LU-Verse

This is the first website I have ever created. It taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The site is frontend-only, as that was the scope of the related university course.

This website is designed to help Lebanese university students stay updated by providing class schedules, course information, lecture recaps, and announcements all in one place.

The most valuable lesson I learned—something I wish I had known earlier—was how useful Flexbox is!
I still have a lot to learn, especially in design. For example, I regret not taking better advantage of the desktop screen width, but this project is my starting point.

Note: The PDF links on the I2202 pages are broken because I don’t have permission to share my teacher’s course materials.
Also, we only made an I2202 page, as replicating that for other courses was unnecessary.
